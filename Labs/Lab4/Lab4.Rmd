Lab 4 Assignment
Pstat 174/274
In this question we keep studying Task 1 in Lab 4 where we import monthly-australian-wine-sales-th.csv and use ts() command.
1) Compare the plots of the series ‘wine1’ and ‘wine’ defined below, and state why we use ‘frequency=12’ in the lab material.
       wine1 = ts(wine.csv[,2], start = c(1980,1))
       wine = ts(wine.csv[,2], start = c(1980,1), frequency = 12)
2) If you have a daily data of wine sales, for example from Jan 1, 1981 to Dec 31,1983. What value would you put in ‘frequency=’ so that the plot shows the correct year index on x-axis?
