Xt =5+0.85Xt−1 −0.02Xt−3 +Zt,Zt ∼WN(0,σ2). The revenues for the last 4 years are as follows:
Year Revenue 2019 20 2020 15 2021 22 2022 19

### Question 1
Time series {X~t~} follows stationary AR(1) model X~t~ = $\phi_0$ + $\phi_1$X~t−1~ + Z~t~, Z~t~ ∼ N(0, σ~Z~^2^). Determine which of the following statements about this model is false.\

  (A) the parameter $\phi_0$ must not equal 1.\
  
  - FALSE. The parameter $\phi_0$ is a constant that only affects the value of the mean of the AR(1) model. For a stationary process its mean does not depend on time, i.e., a constant.\
  
  (B) The absolute value of the parameter $\phi_1$ must be less than 1.\
  
  - TRUE. In order to remain stationary, the coefficients of an AR(p) model must all have absolute values lower than 1, otherwise to ensure that the roots are outside of the unit circle.\
  
  (C) If the parameter $\phi_1$ = 0, then the model reduces to a white noise process.\
  
  - TRUE. If $\phi_1=0$, then the equation of the model is simplified to $X_t=\phi_0+Z_t$ where $\phi_0$ is the drift.\
  
  (D) If the parameter $\phi_1$ = 1, then the model is a random walk.\
  
  - TRUE. If $\phi_1$ = 1, then the model can be simplified to a random walk with a drift of $\phi_0$.\
  
  (E) Only the immediate past value X~t−1~, is used as a predictor for X~t~.\
  
  - TRUE\
\
  
### Question 2
(Updating forecasts) You use AR(1) model X~t~ − 100 = 0.6(X~t−1~ − 100) + Z~t~ to represent a time series of 100 observations. You are given that X~100~ = 110. You later observe X~101~ = 95. Calculate P~101~X~103~ − P~100~X~103~.\
*(Hint: review Example 13.1 on slides 9 - 10 of Week 7.)*\

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{For general h: }& P_nX_{n+h} = \phi_1^hX_n\\\\
\phi_1 = 0.6;\ \ \ \ X_{100}=110;&\ \ \ \ X_{101}=95;\ \ \ \ Y_t=X_t-100\\\\
&\text{Calculate }P_{101}X_{103}-P_{100}X_{103}\\\\
&\text{First, solve for } P_{101}X_{103}:\\
\hat{Y}_{101}(2) & = P_{101}Y_{101+2}\\
&= \phi_1^2\ Y_{101}\\
\hat{X}_{101}(3)&=0.6^3(X_{101}-100)\\
&=100 + 0.216(110-100)\\
&=102.16
&\text{Next, solve for } P_{100}X_{103}\\
\hat{Y}_{100}(3) & = P_{100}Y_{100+3}\\
&= \phi_1^3\ Y_{100}\\
\hat{X}_{100}(3)&=0.6^3(X_{100}-100)\\
&=100 + 0.216(110-100)\\
&=102.16

3. You are given the AR(3) model for Xt, a company’s revenue for year t:
    Forecast the expected revenue for 2024. (Hint: review Example 13.2 of week 7, slide 11.)
4. A Gaussian AR(1) model was fitted to a time series based on a sample of size n. You are given
φˆ = 0.8, μˆ = 2, σˆ2 = 9 × 10−4, x = 2.05. Write the 95% prediction interval for the observation three 1Zn
periods ahead.
Hint: review Example 13.1 of Week 7; slide 10. Do not forget that the mean is not 0!
The following problem is for students enrolled in PSTAT 274 ONLY
G1. A Gaussian AR(1) model was fitted to a time series based on a sample of size n = 51. You are given: μˆ = 16.75, φˆ = 0.75. The last observation was x = 20.25, and the sum of the squares of the
 1 51
51 residuals is 75.7. Determine the upper bound of the shortest 95% probability limit for the forecast of the observation two time periods ahead.
