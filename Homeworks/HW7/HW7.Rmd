### Question 1
Time series {X~t~} follows stationary AR(1) model X~t~ = $\phi_0$ + $\phi_1$X~t−1~ + Z~t~, Z~t~ ∼ N(0, σ~Z~^2^). Determine which of the following statements about this model is false.\

  (A) the parameter $\phi_0$ must not equal 1.\
    *- FALSE. The parameter $\phi_0$ is a constant that only affects the value of the mean of the AR(1) model. For a stationary process its mean does not depend on time, i.e., a constant.*\
  
  (B) The absolute value of the parameter $\phi_1$ must be less than 1.\
    *- TRUE. In order to remain stationary, the coefficients of an AR(p) model must all have absolute values lower than 1, otherwise to ensure that the roots are outside of the unit circle.*\
  
  (C) If the parameter $\phi_1$ = 0, then the model reduces to a white noise process.\
    *- TRUE. If $\phi_1=0$, then the equation of the model is simplified to $X_t=\phi_0+Z_t$ where $\phi_0$ is the drift.*\
  
  (D) If the parameter $\phi_1$ = 1, then the model is a random walk.\
    *- TRUE. If $\phi_1$ = 1, then the model can be simplified to a random walk with a drift of $\phi_0$.*\
  
  (E) Only the immediate past value X~t−1~, is used as a predictor for X~t~.\
    *- TRUE*\
\
  
### Question 2
(Updating forecasts) You use AR(1) model X~t~ − 100 = 0.6(X~t−1~ − 100) + Z~t~ to represent a time series of 100 observations. You are given that X~100~ = 110. You later observe X~101~ = 95. Calculate P~101~X~103~ − P~100~X~103~.\
*(Hint: review Example 13.1 on slides 9 - 10 of Week 7.)*\

$$
\begin{aligned}
&\text{For general h: } P_nX_{n+h} = \phi_1^hX_n\\
\phi_1 &= 0.6;\ \ \ \ X_{100}=110;\ \ \ \ X_{101}=95;\\\
&\text{Calculate }P_{101}X_{103}-P_{100}X_{103}\\\\
\text{First, solve for }& P_{101}X_{103}:\\
P_{101}X_{103} & = P_{101}X_{101+2}\\
&= \phi_1^2\ X_{101}\\
&=0.6^2(95)\\
&=0.36(95)\\
&=34.2\\\\
\text{Next, solve for }& P_{100}X_{103}:\\
P_{100}X_{103} & = P_{100}X_{100+3}\\
&= \phi_1^3\ X_{100}\\
&=0.6^3(110)\\
&=0.216(110)\\
&=23.76\\\\
P_{101}X_{103}-P_{100}X_{103} & = 34.2-23.76\\
&=10.44
\end{aligned}

### Question 3
You are given the AR(3) model for X~t~, a company’s revenue for year t: X~t~ = 5 + 0.85X~t−1~ −0.02X~t−3~ +Z~t~, Z~t~∼WN(0,σ^2^). The revenues for the last 4 years are as follows:\

| Year | Revenue |
|:----:|:-------:|
| 2019 | 20 |
| 2020 | 15 |
| 2021 | 22 |
| 2022 | 19 |

Forecast the expected revenue for 2024. *(Hint: review Example 13.2 of week 7, slide 11.)*\
\
$$
\begin{aligned}
X_t = 5 + & 0.85X_{t-1}-0.02X_{t-3}+Z_t\\\\
P_nX_{n+1} &= E_n[X_{n+1}]\\
P_{2022}X_{2023} &= E_{2022}[X_{2023}]\\
& = E[5 + \phi_1X_{t-1}+\phi_2X_{t-3} +Z_{t}]\\
& = E[5 + \phi_1X_{2022}+\phi_2X_{2020} +Z_{2022}]\\
&= 5 + \phi_1X_{2022}+\phi_2X_{2020}\\
&= 5 + 0.85(19)-0.02(15) + 0\\
&= 20.85\\\\
P_nX_{n+2} &= E_n[X_{n+2}]\\
P_{2022}X_{2024} &= E_{2022}[X_{2024}]\\
& = E[5 + \phi_1X_{t-1}+\phi_2X_{t-3} +Z_{t}]\\
& = E[5 + \phi_1X_{2023}+\phi_2X_{2021} +Z_{2023}]\\
&= 5 + \phi_1X_{2022}+\phi_2X_{2020}\\
&= 5 + 0.85(20.85)-0.02(22) + 0\\
&= 22.2825
\end{aligned}

### Question 4
A Gaussian AR(1) model was fitted to a time series based on a sample of size n. You are given
$\hat{\phi}_1$ = 0.8, $\hat{\mu}$ = 2, $\hat{\sigma}^2_Z$ = 9 × 10^−4^, x~n~ = 2.05. Write the 95% prediction interval for the observation three periods ahead.\

*Hint: review Example 13.1 of Week 7; slide 10. Do not forget that the mean is not 0!*\

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Given: }& \hat{\phi}_1 = 0.8,\ \ \ \hat{\mu} = 2,\ \ \ \hat{\sigma}^2_Z = 9 × 10^{−4},\ \ \ x_n = 2.05\\
\text{Calculate the 95% prediction} & \text{ interval for the observation three periods ahead}\\
P_nX_{n+h}\ &\pm\ \Phi_{1-\alpha/2}\ \sigma_n(h)\\\\
&µ=c+\phi_1µ\\
&2=c+0.8(2)\\
&c=2-1.6\\
&c=0.4\\\\
P_nX_{n+h} &= P_nX_{n+3}\\
&=c+\phi_1^3X_n \\
&= 0.4+0.8^3  * 2.05\\
&=1.4496\\\\
\Phi_{1-\alpha/2}& = \Phi_{0.975}\\
&=1.96
\end{aligned}
$$
\
$$
\begin{aligned}
\sigma_n^2(h)&=\sigma_Z^2 \sum_{j=0}^{h-1} \psi_j^2,\ \ with\ \psi(z)=\theta(z)/\phi(z)\\
\sigma_n^2(3)&=\sigma_Z^2 \sum_{j=0}^{3-1} \psi_j^2\\
&=9*10^{-4}\ (\psi_0^2+\psi_1^2+\psi_2^2)\\
&=9*10^{-4}\ (\phi_1^{0^2}+\phi_1^{1^2}+\phi_1^{2^2})\\
&=9*10^{-4}\ (1+0.8^2+0.8^4)\\
&=9*10^{-4}\ (2.0496)\\
&=0.00184464\\
\sigma_n(3)& = \sqrt{\sigma_n^2(3)}\\
&=\sqrt{0.00184464}\\
&=0.04295
\end{aligned}
$$
\
$$
\begin{aligned}
& \ \ \ \ \ (P_nX_{n+h}\ \pm\ \Phi_{1-\alpha/2}\ \sigma_n(h))\\
&=(1.4496\ \pm\ 1.96(0.04295))\\
&= (1.4496\ \pm\ 0.084182)\\
&=(1.365, \ 1.534 )
\end{aligned}

### Question G1
A Gaussian AR(1) model was fitted to a time series based on a sample of size n = 51. You are given: $\hat{\mu}$  = 16.75, $\hat{\phi}_1$ = 0.75.
